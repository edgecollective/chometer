using ver5 on server to test posting updates

ver10 seems to work with circuitpython, but not with python script?

going back to ver8 and testing ...
- ver 8 works with python script ..
- does it work with circuitpython?
- trying with spud3.py, which seems appropriate
- circuitpython needs actual IP address, instead of 'localhost', even when going locally (makes sense, I think)
- success.
- just reconfirming the python script also works ... 
- works.

now going to try to put it on the server ...

using ver8a, and changing to port 8002 so don't conflict with what is already running.
- works

okay, ver8b:  try to pull in data from previous posts ...

- and now try on ver8b
- works on remote server via python script ...
- works on circuitpython

ver8b works!
